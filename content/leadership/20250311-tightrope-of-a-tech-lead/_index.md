# Tightrope of a Tech Lead

---

## Balancing Involvement as a Tech Lead
### How much direction should you give?

---

## Who am I?
- Ian Tweedie
- Developer, Chair, Consultant, Trustee, Architect, Lead
- Senior Technical Consultant at Capgemini

---

## The Leadership Spectrum
- **Facilitator:** Oversees but not deeply involved
- **Strict Control:** Dictates every action
- Finding balance is key

---

## What Influences the Right Level of Direction?
- **Team size**
- **Team experience**
- **Project complexity**
- **Scope and timeline**
- **Regulatory constraints**

---

## Bottlenecks - The Biggest Challenge
- When a single person holds too much knowledge
- Progress slows when that person is unavailable
- Teams become reliant instead of self-sufficient

---

## Breaking the Bottleneck
- Identify and **act quickly**
- Encourage **knowledge sharing**
- Create **backup expertise**

---

## How to Grow Your Team
- Push people **out of their comfort zone**
- Allow controlled **escalation** to break reliance
- Use **drivers and instructors** for guided learning

---

## Leadership = Empowerment
- It’s not about making every decision
- It’s about **empowering others to make the right ones**

---

## Why Balance Matters
- **Too much control?** Teams feel suffocated
- **Too little direction?** Teams feel lost
- The right balance = high-performing teams

---

## Final Thought
**Good people don’t leave bad projects; they leave bad leadership.**

---

## Thank You!
**Any questions?**
